Requirements
•	Demonstrate use of REST conventions
•	Create the specified API routes/endpoints and list the endpoints in documentation.
•	Use object oriented programming to create data structures mirroring talks and attendees
•	Create RESTful routes of the form:
o	POST baseurl/talksto add a talk
o	POST baseurl/attendees to add an attendee
o	POST baseurl/talks/:talk_id/attendees to add an attendee to a talk (or PUT baseurl/talks/:talk_id/attendees/:attendee_id)
